## üìú Project History

* **2022**:
  TCGPR was first proposed and implemented, in collaboration with Mr. Hao Yuan (experiments) and Mr. Qinghua Wei (experiments). It was successfully applied to the optimization of lead-free solder alloys.

## üîß Installation

Install TCGPR via PyPI:

```bash
pip install PyTcgpr
```

To verify the installation:

```bash
pip show PyTcgpr
```

To upgrade to the latest version:

```bash
pip install --upgrade PyTcgpr
```

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Data Screening | Partition Mode

```python
from PyTcgpr import TCGPR

TCGPR.fit(
    filePath = "data.csv",
    initial_set_cap = 3,
    sampling_cap = 2,
    up_search = 500,
    CV = 'LOOCV',
    Task = 'Partition'
)
```

### 2. Data Screening | Identification Mode

```python
from PyTcgpr import TCGPR

TCGPR.fit(
    filePath = "data.csv",
    sampling_cap = 2,
    up_search = 500,
    CV = 'LOOCV',
    Task = 'Identification'
)
```

### 3. Feature Selection Mode

```python
from PyTcgpr import TCGPR

TCGPR.fit(
    filePath = "data.csv",
    Mission = 'FEATURE',
    sampling_cap = 2,
    up_search = 500,
    CV = 'LOOCV'
)
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Parameters

```python
:param Mission: str, default='DATA'
    - 'DATA': Perform data screening
    - 'FEATURE': Perform feature selection

:param filePath: str
    Path to input dataset in CSV format

:param initial_set_cap: int or list
    Initial subset size or index list for Partition mode

:param sampling_cap: int, default=1
    Number of items selected per iteration

:param measure: str, default='Pearson'
    Correlation type: 'Pearson' or 'Determination'

:param ratio: float
    Tolerance threshold for correlation-based filtering

:param target: int, default=1
    Number of targets in regression (for feature selection)

:param weight: float, default=0.2
    Weight coefficient in GGMF score calculation

:param up_search: int, default=500
    Upper limit for search iterations

:param exploit_coef: float, default=2
    Variance constraint for EI acquisition function

:param exploit_model: bool, default=False
    If True, disables GGMF and uses only R values

:param CV: int or str, default=10
    Cross-validation: integer (e.g., 5, 10) or 'LOOCV'
```
