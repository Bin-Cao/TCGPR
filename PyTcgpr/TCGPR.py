    Parameters
    ----------
    :param defined in TCGPR
    ==================================================================
    :param Mission : str, the mission of TCGPR, 
        default Mission = 'DATA' for data screening. 
        Mission = 'FEATURE' for feature selection.

    :param filePath: the input dataset in csv format

    :param initial_set_cap: 
    for Mission = 'DATA':
        if Task = 'Partition':
        initial_set_cap : the capacity of the initial dataset
        int, default = 3, recommend = 3-10
        or a list : 
        i.e.,  
        [3,4,8], means the 4-th, 5-th, 9-th datum will be collected as the initial dataset
        elif Task = 'Identification':
        param initial_set_cap is masked 
    for Mission = 'FEATURE':
        initial_set_cap : the capacity of the initial featureset
        int, default = 1, recommend = 1-5
        or a list : i.e.,  
        [3,4,8], means the 4-th, 5-th, 9-th feature will be selected as the initial characterize

    :param sampling_cap: 
    for Mission = 'DATA':
        int, the number of data added to the updating dataset at each iteration, default = 1, recommend = 1-5
    for Mission = 'FEATURE':
        int, the number of features added to the updating feature set at each iteration, default = 1, recommend = 1-3

    :param ratio: 
    for Mission = 'DATA':
        if Task = 'Partition':
        tolerance, lower boundary of R is (1-ratio)Rmax, default = 0.2, recommend = 0~0.3
        elif Task = 'Identification':
        tolerance, lower boundary of R is (1+ratio)R[last], default = 0.0, recommend = -0.01~0.01
    for Mission = 'FEATURE':
        tolerance, lower boundary of R is (1+ratio)R[last], default = -0.01, recommend = -0.01~0.01

    :param target:
    used in feature selection when Mission = 'FEATURE'
        int, default 1, the number of target in regression mission
        target = 1 for single_task regression and =k for k_task regression (Multiobjective regression)
    otherwise : param target is masked 
    
    :param weight
    a weight imposed on R value in calculating GGMF, default = 2 , recommend =  1-10
    i.e.,
        weight * (1-R) +  mean / std (mean, std is the mean and standard deviation of length scales) 

    :param up_search: 
    for Mission = 'DATA':
        up boundary of candidates for brute force search, default = 5e2 , recommend =  2e2-2e3
    for Mission = 'FEATURE':
        up boundary of candidates for brute force search, default = 10 , recommend = 10-20

    :param exploit_coef: constrains to the magnitude of variance in Cal_EI function, default = 2, recommend = 2

    :param exploit_model: boolean, default, False
        exploit_model == True, the searching direction will be R only! GGMF will not be used!

    :param CV: cross validation, default = 10
        e.g. (int) CV = 5,10,... or str CV = 'LOOCV' for leave one out cross validation

    :param defined in Gpr of sklearn package
    ==================================================================
    [sklearn]alpha : float or array-like of shape (n_samples), default=1e-10
            Value added to the diagonal of the kernel matrix during fitting.
            Larger values correspond to increased noise level in the observations.
            This can also prevent a potential numerical issue during fitting, by
            ensuring that the calculated values form a positive definite matrix.
            If an array is passed, it must have the same number of entries as the
            data used for fitting and is used as datapoint-dependent noise level.
            Note that this is equivalent to adding a WhiteKernel with c=alpha.
            Allowing to specify the noise level directly as a parameter is mainly
            for convenience and for consistency with Ridge.

    [sklearn]optimizer : "fmin_l_bfgs_b" or callable, default="fmin_l_bfgs_b"
            Can either be one of the internally supported optimizers for optimizing
            the kernel's parameters, specified by a string, or an externally
            defined optimizer passed as a callable. If a callable is passed, it
            must have the signature::

            def optimizer(obj_func, initial_theta, bounds):
                # * 'obj_func' is the objective function to be minimized, which
                #   takes the hyperparameters theta as parameter and an
                #   optional flag eval_gradient, which determines if the
                #   gradient is returned additionally to the function value
                # * 'initial_theta': the initial value for theta, which can be
                #   used by local optimizers
                # * 'bounds': the bounds on the values of theta
                ....
                # Returned are the best found hyperparameters theta and
                # the corresponding value of the target function.
                return theta_opt, func_min

            Per default, the 'L-BGFS-B' algorithm from scipy.optimize.minimize
            is used. If None is passed, the kernel's parameters are kept fixed.
            Available internal optimizers are::

                'fmin_l_bfgs_b'

    [sklearn]n_restarts_optimizer : int, default=10
            The number of restarts of the optimizer for finding the kernel's
            parameters which maximize the log-marginal likelihood. The first run
            of the optimizer is performed from the kernel's initial parameters,
            the remaining ones (if any) from thetas sampled log-uniform randomly
            from the space of allowed theta-values. If greater than 0, all bounds
            must be finite. Note that n_restarts_optimizer == 0 implies that one
            run is performed.

    [sklearn]normalize_y : boolean, optional (default: False)
            Whether the target values y are normalized, the mean and variance of
            the target values are set equal to 0 and 1 respectively. This is
            recommended for cases where zero-mean, unit-variance priors are used.
            Note that, in this implementation, the normalisation is reversed
            before the GP predictions are reported.
